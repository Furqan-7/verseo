// Keeps the CreatorOS copy on the page after Framer's runtime takes over.
//
// The section components already render CreatorOS text, but Framer's own
// runtime (loaded from framerusercontent.com) re-renders parts of the page a
// few seconds after load from its copy of the original Verseo template, which
// puts the old words back. This script watches the DOM and swaps each old
// string for its CreatorOS version as soon as it appears. MutationObserver
// callbacks run before the browser paints, so the old text never shows.
//
// Swaps are scoped to the section named by the nearest data-framer-name
// ancestor, because the same template string can need different copy in
// different sections. Anything outside those sections uses the global map.

It brings your inbox, brand deals, content, calendar and analytics into one place, gives you a daily briefing, and does the busywork - sorting messages, drafting replies, writing captions and chasing payments - so you spend more time creating.",
    "Who is CreatorOS designed for?": "Creators who run their own business: full-time YouTubers, Instagram and TikTok creators, and the managers and small teams who work with them. If you juggle brand deals, an inbox and a posting schedule, it's built for you.",
    "Will it post or send anything on its own?": "No. CreatorOS prepares replies, captions, invoices and calendar events, but nothing is sent, posted or booked until you approve it. Emails are saved as drafts in your Gmail.",
    "Which platforms does it work with?": "Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive and YouTube connect directly. Instagram and TikTok work through imports for now, and posts for every platform are prepared and scheduled from one board.",
    "Where do the content ideas come from?": "From your own audience and numbers: questions people repeat in your comments, the formats and topics that perform best for you, and the niche and goals you set. Every idea shows why it was picked.",
    "How much time will it save me?": "It depends on how much you post, but sorting messages, drafting replies, writing captions for each platform and chasing payments add up to hours every week. Your daily briefing shows the time CreatorOS has saved you."
